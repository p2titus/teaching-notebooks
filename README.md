# Teaching notebooks

Python is a really cool language. In my experience, things just work when using it. However, it can be hard to pin down exactly what's going on beneath the hood, especially when the user doesn't have much experience with other languages. These notebooks aim to give an understandable but accurate account of what actually happening with some common data science libraries.

Notebooks will be added when I come up with them. I will try to finish them, but there's no guarantee I will
