    "## A small history and context of Python\n",
    "[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) is a general purpose programming language conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum. It has [20 guiding principles](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/). Python is an [interpreted language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)), meaning an *interpreter* only translates source code to machine code at runtime (when the program is being run). This constrasts with a [compiled language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler), where this translation happens statically at compile time, prior to code being run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of interpreted languages include Python and JavaScript. Examples of compiled languages include C, C++, Rust and Ocaml. There are many languages of each type - too many to list in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of probable use, but unrelated to this notebook, is [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), a style guide to Python code. Following this should help increase the readability of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A brief introduction to Types\n",
    "Most programming languages have the concept of a *type*. More formally, a *type* is a set of rules dictating what an expression can and cannot do. Less formally, a *type* is some information about expressions that another program can use to judge whether a program makes sense. We will expand on these notions presently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Informally, we can agree that members of the following sets are different:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\mathbb{R}\\\\\n",
    "\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{R}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The operation $(2, 3) + 7$ makes no sense. Similarly, $x + (y, z)$ has no obvious definition. A definition of $+$ could be constructed, but there is no obvious definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, consider the following (Python) function definition"

    "## Python and Types\n",
    "Python uses what is called [duck typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)#Typing). You've definitely heard me say 'if it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.' In practice, this means if an object has all methods required by a type, then it can act as a member of that type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is dynamically typed. This means there are no compile time checks, which means the first time you could know about a type error is when your code crashes in production from an unexpected input. How frustrating. This also means the type of things can change in hard-to-predict ways during program execution. This can be an issue, but is often fine if you remain disciplined with your programs. Something Python's syntax and style guides can help you achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrary to all I've said previously, Python *is* strongly typed. This means if it comes across an operation that doesn't make sense (like trying to add a number to a word), it won't silently try to make sense of the expression. It will just crash. This is *extremely* frustrating when dealing with large programs, which could often use a computer sense checking everything. By and large, strong typing is probably the better choice to make, not least because of the insanity that lies down weak typing. See JavaScript, where weak equality is *not* transitive (i.e. a == b and b == c does not necessarily mean that a == c) and expressions can sometimes behave differently depending on the type of the first variable. I'm getting worked up just typing (haha) about it. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, all this ducktyping guff without static checks does mean that, in well written libraries, Python *just works*. This is huge, and I can't stress how nice a feature of the language this is. I've never had such a welcoming and easy to pick up experience as Python, and the type system probably plays a huge, understated part in that.\n",

    "## Pandas DataFrames\n",
    "A Pandas DataFrame is a data structure containing information about some data. Often `read_csv` or `read_sql` is used to read data to the DataFrame. A crucial difference between a DataFrame and the `csv` file is that the DataFrame is held in RAM, whereas the `csv` is held in secondary storage (e.g. on the hard drive). Holding the data in RAM means its much quicker to perform operations on, but RAM loses data once turned off, whilst secondary storage does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Pandas DataFrame has column names and an index. The index is numerical and starts at 0,\n",
    "\n",
